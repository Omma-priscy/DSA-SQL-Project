# DSA-SQL-Project
This is my first SQL Project done with the Digital Skill up Africa where I got my SQL skills from.
This project is about Kutra Mega stores (KMS), headquartered in lagos, specialized in office suppliance
and funiture.
I have been engaged as a Businwss Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of KMS. The Business
Manager has shared an Excel File Containing order data from 2009 to 2012 and has requested that I analyze 
the data and present my key insights and findings.
